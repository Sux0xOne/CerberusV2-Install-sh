<font color="#A52A2A">Cerberus is a well-known banking Trojan for Android that we already discussed in a comprehensive report on how it works in October 2019, when it began to affect Spanish and Latin American entities.</font>

### Its popularity has been growing rapidly in recent months, so much so that the differences between the number of detections of this family compared to those of the 'Anubis Bankbot' family, the most popular to date, has been reduced. Of the new features that it incorporates, perhaps the most interesting is its conversion into a Remote Access Trojan (RAT).

This banking malware is back in the news; not only because of its popularity, but because of the new version that has been detected starting February 19, 2020. Nothing new has been introduced in the section on banking credential theft, maintaining the usual Android banking Trojan modus operandi (the use of 'overlays' with phishing).

However, these recent versions of the popular banking Trojan do incorporate several interesting novelties that, little by little, put it on a level with its rival Anubis Bankbot in functionalities.
